/**
 * An elevated three-quarter view of the tile, like the aerial illustrations:
 * high enough to read the whole patchwork, low enough that the far side is
 * genuinely farther away (so boats shrink as they sail off). It is a real
 * perspective camera; its distance is solved so the tile, with a margin of
 * paper, fills the frame at any aspect ratio. Tall screens turn a quarter
 * turn so the tile's long side runs down the phone.
